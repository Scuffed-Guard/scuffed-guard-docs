# ðŸ“¬ Adding partners

Partner requests/offers work like a friend request, one server sends and the other accepts.

### Sending a partner request

Use the command `/p offer` to send a partner request to another server.

{% hint style="info" %}
if you do not have default values set() you'd have to provide all options while using the command unless you want exclusive fields(channel, invite etc) for given partner.
{% endhint %}

default values are used for any fields that are not provided.
{% endembed %}

### Accepting a partner request

You can accept a received request using `/p accept` which automatically shows the received requests with server names and IDs.&#x20;

**NOTE:** If it does not show a server, you can always provide it a server ID which is not in the options. though this should rarely be the case.

NOTE: The request sender server cannot review/confirm the pings offered by the server who received and accepted the partnership (_yet)_. Therefore it is advised to strictly mind this.

{% hint style="info" %}
Similar to sending requests, you can provide _special_ or custom fields for a specific partner. [#providing-custom-values-for-a-partner](adding-partners.md#providing-custom-values-for-a-partner "mention")
{% endhint %}

### Providing custom values for a partner

If you have to offer a custom channel, invite, cooldown, or any field to a specific partner you may provide the optional values while sending/accepting requests.

{% embed url="https://guarddocs.shx.is/6jOfX_69N" %}
offering a special channel to a partner (not the default channel set in settings)
{% endembed %}
